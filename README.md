# üîê Enhancing Security & Privacy of Cryptocurrency Transactions

**üìÖ Duration:** January 2023 ‚Äì May 2023  
**üéì Type:** Graduate Research Project  
**üë®‚Äçüíª Role:** Java Developer & Security Analyst  
**üß† Focus:** Cryptographic Security, Transaction Integrity, Threat Simulation

---

## üìå Project Summary

This project explores how **advanced encryption** and **custom transaction validation logic** can be applied to improve the **security and privacy of cryptocurrency transactions**. The goal was to simulate a transaction flow similar to modern blockchain platforms and protect user data using **AES encryption** and proper validation rules.

We tested for common vulnerabilities like **replay attacks**, **data tampering**, and **unauthorized access**, and documented improvements to strengthen the system.


## üîê Key Features

### üß¨ AES Encryption for Wallet Data
- Wallet data (private keys, user info) is encrypted using **AES-256** with securely generated keys.
- Prevents raw access to sensitive information, even if breached.

### üîç Custom Transaction Validation
- Transactions undergo checks for **duplicate IDs**, **tampered amounts**, and **invalid signatures**.
- Logic simulates behavior of real blockchain platforms and ensures **integrity**.

### ‚öîÔ∏è Attack Simulations
- Conducted manual simulations of:
  - **Replay attacks** (re-sending valid transactions maliciously)
  - **Tampering attacks** (modifying values post-signing)
- Verified that only valid, untampered transactions proceed.

### üìâ Performance Awareness
- Designed encryption and validation modules to minimize processing time.
- Prioritized a balance between **security and system responsiveness**.

## ü§ù Collaboration

This was a **team-based project**:
- I led the implementation of the **Java encryption modules**
- Worked on **risk analysis and threat modeling**
- Contributed to final presentation and documentation

We used a sprint-based approach, tracked progress in Notion, and conducted weekly code reviews using GitHub.
